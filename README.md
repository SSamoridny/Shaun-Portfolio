# Shaun-Portfolio

In this portfolio I tried to follow the guidelines as well as added a few things of my own. My goal was to build something where I could show my future skills as well as simply challenging myself to make a responsive layout with all of the working links.

I was able to use google fonts, icons, bootstrap and made multiple working links to various sites to show off future social media work as well as simply keeping customers aware of the various platforms available. Of course these would have real life examples in the future but for now, they simply go to  the mainpages of each site. 

I think that I made a responsive layout showing "my portfolio of work" with a handful of my favourite sites (obviously none of which I have actually worked on). For the purposes of this assignment I linked them and showed them as work of mine. 

Lastly was a simple Contact form as well as some workarounds like "break-word" to help with layout issues on small devices. Personally I would say this isn't completely ideal but I guess that is a good lesson of keeping mobile in mind when doing the initial layout or possibly using some media queries later on. All in all I hope that you enjoy my work.

Thank you,
Shaun Samoridny
